# 🗂️ MVC Contact Form - Node.js, Express, EJS, SQL

This project is a **contact form** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **EJS**, and a **SQL test database**, structured with the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.

It was one of my first complete backend projects, created to test and demonstrate my skills in server-side development, database handling, and clean project structure.
